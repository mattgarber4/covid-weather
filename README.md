# Covid Weather
Analysis of COVID-19 spread in the US by weather patterns


NOTE: To run the data manipulations, extract `raw/2020-weather.zip` directly to the raw folder as `raw/2020-weather.csv`.

Then, to produce the entire transformation pipeline, run `generate-station-subset.R` then `station-geocode.ipynb` then `covid-weather-combine.R`.
